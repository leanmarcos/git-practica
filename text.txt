Oh darling, please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
Oh darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Don't ever leave me alone
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and died
Oh darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me, darlin'
When you told me, woo, you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly fell down and died
Oh darling, please believe me
I'll never let you down
Oh, believe me, darlin'
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
